          grant one wish to anyone who collects all seven of them. The girl
          wants to find all of them and make a wish for a good boyfriend. Goku
          has one dragon ball. However, he has no desire to give it away.

          Expect a lot of fighting and humor! You shouldn't expect a grand story
          from a fighting shounen. The fights are not ludicurously long here, so
          it's not boring to watch. Actually, it's very exciting! I have to
          admit that the animation and art are not the best here in comparison
          to modern anime. However, there's some charm in the old art style.
          Dragonball is a must-watch for anyone who likes anime. Give this
          remarkable classic a try!

          One Piece is a great anime that you can easily become obsessed with!
          The show starts off with the Pirate King revealing the existance of
          One Piece, the treasure that will give its owner an unlimited amount
          of riches and fame. He reveals that before his execution. The anime
          follows Monkey D. Luffy, a teenage boy who forms his crew and travels
          across the Grand Line, battles strong enemies, and experiences
          different adventures in order to reach the greatest treasure. You will
          fall in love with each and every member of Luffy´s crew. All these
          characters are well developed and unique with their different and fun
          personalities. The beginning mostly spends time introducing the
          characters, though you will always find some action in these episodes.
          However, once the formed crew reaches their destination, you will dive
          into endless adventure!
        </p>
        <p>
          The fans of this show recommend watching it in its original Japanese
          language with subtitles. That way, you can be sure the episodes are
          not cut, edited, and the characters are not given ridiculous voices.
          It should be noted that the art style in this anime is completely
          different from its contemporaries. It´s much more cartoonish.

          Pokemon is considered to be one of the most popular anime series out
          there. This show is fun and has adventure, action, and morals. Since
          the show is aimed primarily at kids, it teaches them many moral
          lessons. The road trip stories never take place in one town, so you
          won't be annoyed. Give this cute show a try, especially if you have
          experienced this franchise in other mediums such as games or cards.

          The story centers on Satoshi, a 10-year-old boy who has always dreamed

          all three Pokemon for beginners have already been taken. Only one is
          left, a rebellious electric Pokemon named Pikachu. Satoshi and Pikachu
          set out on a journey to become the best among the best. That's when

          You will love the degree of emotions in this show. There are so many
          heart-wrenching moments that it will make you really worry about the
          characters or even cry a river! There are so many reasons to love this
          vastly popular anime series! First of all, it has character
          development. Everyone in the series has their dark past which binds
          the viewer to the story. We can't deny the fact that even antagonists
          in this show are likeable because they each have their own justified
          reasons. There are so many lovable, smart, and righteous characters!
          Another thing that makes Naruto so special is a deeply developed jutsu
          structure; each character is not simply overloaded with powers. They
          have their own unique fighting style. This complexity is one of the
          things that makes the series different from others.

          If you are looking for comedy, romance, dramatic moments, and a great
          soundtrack, Sailor Moon should be your choice. The romance and comedy
          here are well balanced with some funny moments and it works well! The
          characters here are so easy to relate to! They are cute, lovable, and
          relatable in many ways. This show may seem childish (primarily because
          of the voices in dubbed version), but it actually covers a lot of
          issues such as sexuality, violence, and many relationship problems.
          Many fans of this anime series say that it's better to avoid the
          English dubbed version. They recommend that you watch it with
          subtitles because the voice acting is way better in the original
          Japanese version.

          Fullmetal Alchemist tells the story of two brothers who make an
          attempt to bring their mother back to life. According to the
          fundamental law of alchemy, in order to get something, an alchemist
          must sacrifice something of the same value. Thus, one of the brothers
          loses an arm and the other loses his entire body (his soul becomes
          bonded into a suit of armor). Soon, the brothers learn about the
          existence of the Philosopher Stone, which has the ability to transcend
          the laws of alchemy. Our heroes decide to embark on a quest to get
          that stone. The further they go, the more they realize they are drawn

          As you might have already guessed, this series belongs to one of the
          most popular anime genres, shounen, which is aimed at teenage boys.
          They usually feature a male protagonist who embarks on a dangerous
          adventure. Actually, Fullmetal Alchemist has a more intricate and
          complex story then many other shounens. It's also different from many
          other entries in this genre because it takes place in a fictionalized
          world with a setting of somewhere in European the early 20th century.
          This action fantasy anime is considered a must-watch for any anime fan
          as well as those who are new to the world of anime! If you are still

          (of the sea), just the tip the iceberg. It also uses puns and
          different language dialects for characters and moves alike; and unlike
          a certain manga/anime series where you can wish someone back to life,
          characters stay dead and more importantly it invokes one of the
          greatest and most terrible things in story-telling; the concept and
          transference of loss. Even though the story is a comedy/adventure
          series, you can see that many of the characters have experienced loss
          in the past or in the present; and as a reader I feel their pain even
          though I have not experienced watching someone die but have
          experienced the death of a loved one. This story is far from over, and
          I can't wait to see the battles with the four emperors and their
          crews, when the end come I hope all we dedicated fans and readers are
          more than satisfied with the end.

        <p><strong><a class="list-link" href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/25/Fullmetal_Alchemist?q=2.%20Fullmetal%20Alchemist&cat=manga">2. Fullmetal Alchemist</a></strong></p>
        <p>
          Full Metal Alchemist (the manga, not the original anime-- Brotherhood
          was the better of the two) is probably the most emotional story I've
          ever gone through and stuck with. Originally I wanted nothing to do
          with it because of it being a mainstream choice and having a bad rep
          for the first anime version. When I went back and actually looked into
          it, I was sucked into it. The fact that it takes two almost
          anti-hero's and puts them through struggles similar to what
          adolescents face as they mature is not only remarkable, but it is also
          eye opening. The ultimate antagonist is by far the best I've come
          across. FMA (B) taught me that we cannot hope to be perfect-- there's
          just no such thing. We must revel in being mortal while we live and
          appreciate the time given to us. No matter how many times life knocks
          us down, we MUST push through. There is always a better day. I don't
          know.. But while Naruto is on the top of my own list, Full Metal
          Alchemist quickly comes in right behind it. Go read it or watch
          Brotherhood now. If you haven't yet, you're missing out.

        <p>
          Naruto isn't treasured by a thousand people just because of his
          strength, that is madly WRONG! Many people can't see it, but I do. T
          isn't the fighting the only reason that makes you watch that manga,
          it's the atmosphere. The romance, the laughter, the sadness and
          undeniable anger is the reason, it shows you all your feelings deep
          inside your soul, from the bottom of your heart. My country isn't
          much, not much things that we can brag about, and my school friends
          crazily adore Naruto just because of skill, and when I want to tell
          them that more valuable isn't his skill, but his amazing lion spirit
          that never gave up, that what truly made us smile. But seeing all that
          hope, inspiring shine on my friends eyes makes Me understand that they
          treasure they're version. So, for now that's all I have to say.

        <p>
          Dragon ball is the first series but the second series of dragon ball
          (dragonball z) is the best ever it's awesome anime in the world and we
          can't compare dragon ball z with others because it has the best
          storyline and most action packed and adventurous anime. It's number 1
          anime created in the world ever.

        <p><strong><a class="list-link" href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/2/Berserk?q=5.%20Berserk&cat=manga">5. Berserk</a></strong></p>
        <p>
          I am not shocked to see that Berserk isn't number 1 because in terms
          of popularity, One Piece and everything else above Berserk is more
          popular and have been read by most people. I now give advise to you
          all who haven't read Berserk... READ IT! You will see why this is
          considered by many and most critics to be the greatest manga ever
          created. This manga is so brilliant in story telling, writing,
          characters, art, and pacing that it could also be considered one of
          the greatest fiction works of all time. The dialogue is breath taking,
          and the chemistry between the characters so believable and touching
          that it eventually builds up to what is probably the most horrific
          betrayal scene ever written or drawn on paper. I've read it so many
          times and it still sends shivers down my spine. If you like manga, you
          owe it to yourself to read this masterpiece. An experience you will
          never forget.

        <p><strong><a class="list-link" href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/12/Bleach?q=6.%20Bleach&cat=manga">6. Bleach</a></strong></p>
        <p>
          Most people play favorites on voting so bleach here is down but on all
          on going manga, I do think that bleach the best. Well, people have
          different tastes, but I say that bleach's story is much deeper than
          Naruto's or one piece's that's why most people can't get the full
          essence of its story. I'm not over rating it but it's the truth.
          Although my favorite is bleach, but I can't deny that Naruto is still
          the first because it's well balance. Naruto's story isn't hard to cope
          up with and it's interesting. While bleach's story, as I said earlier
          is more for an adult and people might find it hard to cope up with.
          But if you are able to get its essence then you'll find it as the best
          on going manga (only applicable if you prefer uniformly organized
          structure of literature).. Third is one piece, because if you are an
          adventure lover, you'll like it. But because of its childish
          plot/story you can even skip a few hundreds of episodes/chapters and
          still cope up with the story... Well, it's not my preference so I
          don't like it very much, but I still read its manga. Simplifying
          everything: there are 95% of idiots are in this world and only 5% of
          level headed people. And how many of those idiots and smart people are
          watching/reading anime/manga? I know you know where I'm leading this.
          Let's continue: do you think that those low headed people can get the
          essence of bleach which is deep and hard to cope up for them? I'm not
          insulting any manga or people, it just makes me get irritated to those
          ignorant and stiff headed people who criticize but doesn't have the
          wisdom to do so.

        <p><strong><a class="list-link" href="https://myanimelist.net/manga/21/Death_Note?q=7.%20Death%20Note&cat=manga">7. Death Note</a></strong></p>
        <p>
          This is by far the best manga ever... It completely breaks off the
          model popular shounen manga follow, which is having a character who
          blurs the line between man and beast yet is charismatic as
          protagonist(in simple, the lovable idiot), who is unnaturally
          strong/powerful, and faces off against even stronger enemies to decide
          the fate of the world/universe, who then beat the living pulp out of
          him; and when all hope of defeating him is lost somehow finds the
          strength to carry on and beats him after realizing he's got the fate
          of the people close to hiworld/universe on his back... Don't get me
          wrong, I love all that kind of manga too, Goku was my childhood hero,
          I love naruto too, and fairytail cracks me up (sorry but definitely
          not One piece, haven't seen/read much but what I have has been
          ridiculously dumb, sorry). Anyway you got to admit when it comes to
          quality Death Note by far surpasses any manga there is at the moment.

        <p>
          The attitudes and emotions of all the individual characters are
          realistic and unique. The storyline gets straight to the point,
          there's no messing around. Every chapter has a distinct purpose and
          feels like a lot more happens than in other manga series. It's far
          funnier than the all the manga I read whilst being able to maintain a
          high level of seriousness when it counts. A balance that most manga
          get wrong. All in all this is my favorite manga because it prompts the
          right emotions in the reader at the right times combining the notions
          of fun, family and community with badass fight scenes. It reminds me
          of when I was a kid wishing I was a super saiyan. Only now I wish I
          was a Dragon-Slayer. Too Good to be in 8th spot on any manga list.

          When I saw the sheer volume of its issues, I had thought that I had
          needs year to be done with it and now here I am with the entire manga
          completed in less than one month Absolutely fantastic, for a long time
          I was quite going through the Hangover if having finished it and
          couldn't pick up any manga. Absolutely fab.. DBZ and DB both are love,
          even though I had to vote dbz here.

        <p>
          I first saw the anime and loved the logic of the characters way to
          deal with hunters test and after, when they learned how to use nem,
          it's awesome to see how Gon gets stronger and helps everyone he mets
          while trying to find his father. After the last anime episode in
          treasure island, I had to see if he met Gin, I found the manga and its
          10 times cooler and more bloody! Maybe not the best Manga in the
          world, but it's my top 3.
